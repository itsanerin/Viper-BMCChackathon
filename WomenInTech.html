    <h1> Bringing Women Into STEM: Tackling Lack of Women in Tech </h1>

    <h3><u> Why are there Less Women in Tech Fields? </u> </h3>

    <ul>
        <li> Women feel alienated while working in tech roles, a 1996 USA study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.</li>

        <li> According to the Kapor Center for Social Impact and Harris Poll, 1 in 10 women in tech experience unwanted sexual attention, and nearly one in four people of color face stereotyping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center"><u>How can you help bring more women into STEM?</u></h3>

    <ul>
        <li> Encourage girls to develop an interest in math and sciences is between the ages of 11 and 15</li>

        <li>Have more female role models spoken about in Tech that can inspire the younger generation of women to want to be in tech. For example, Mae Jemison (First African-American woman in Space) and Marissa Mayer (CEO of Yahoo)</li>

        <li>Help bring more awareness with global recognition like October 11th marked the International Day of the Girl, whose purpose is to recognize the obstacles that young girls across the world face, and to encourage female unity and empowerment.</li>

        <li>Understanding and taking a stand against biases that favor male students among science faculty members.</li>

        <li>There is a need for more groups that encourage women to join STEM fields. Groups that can help guide women in tech fields can be an effective tool to retain women in technology roles. Research indicates that in the science, engineering, and technology field, women report feelings of isolation in hostile male-dominated work environments. In the United States, 32% of women who enter the STEM field leave their job within a year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align:center"><u> Our Attempt to Raise Awareness to the Obstacles ahead of Women in STEM </u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We chose the category of Women in Stem to highlight the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. More than 80% of women say they have been sexually assaulted or harassed in comparison to 43% of men. Also, marginalized groups that work in the tech industry experience higher levels of workplace discrimination than workers in other industries.</li>

        <li>The game hosts an woman of color protagonist who has been facing harassment at work. She decides to fight back against the patriarchy and stand up against her coworkers' misogynistic and offensive comments.</li>

        <li>The purpose of the game is to provide a platform where men can play and get a glimpse of what harassment is like from a woman’s perspective. Women can also play and feel empowered in a light-hearted setting that validates their experiences.</li>
    </ul>
